## Development Guidelines

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings to functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Test API endpoints

Example:
```python
async def find_doctors(request: FindDoctorsRequest) -> FindDoctorsResponse: """
    Find doctors based on symptoms using Gemini + Google Maps.
    
    Args:
        request: Request containing symptom text and location
        
    Returns:
        FindDoctorsResponse with recommendations and doctor list
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the search fails
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/React/Next.js)

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components
- Keep components small and focused
- Add proper error handling
- Make UI responsive

Example:
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  data: string;
  onComplete: (result: any) => void;
}

export default function Component({ data, onComplete
}: ComponentProps) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Code Style

**Backend**:
```bash
# Format code
black main.py

# Check types
mypy main.py
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint
npm run lint
```
