# Transcription functionality troubleshooting (2025-10-18 19:55Z)

_**User (2025-10-18 18:56Z)**_

awesome now transcribe is not working 
here is correct implementation import asyncio
import base64
from sarvamai import AsyncSarvamAI

# Load and encode audio file
with open("path/to/your/audio.wav", "rb") as f:
    audio_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")

async def translate_stream():
    client = AsyncSarvamAI(api_subscription_key="your-api-key")

    # Connect to streaming translation
    async with client.speech_to_text_translate_streaming.connect() as ws:
        # Send audio for translation
        await ws.translate(audio=audio_data)
        print("[Debug]: sent audio message")

        # Receive translation response
        resp = await ws.recv()
        print(f"[Debug]: received response: {resp}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(translate_stream())

# --- Notebook/Colab usage ---
# await translate_stream()

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that the transcribe functionality is not working and has provided a correct implementation example for using the SarvamAI SDK for speech-to-text translation with streaming.

Let me first read the current backend/main.py to see what the current implementation looks like.</details></think>

---

I'll check the current implementation of the transcribe endpoint and fix it according to the correct SarvamAI SDK usage.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/vinayakgavariya/aayucare/backend/main.py

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the current implementation on lines 68-99, I can see the transcribe endpoint is already using the correct pattern from the user's example. However, let me compare:

Current implementation (lines 77-83):
```python
async with client.speech_to_text_translate_streaming.connect(
    model="saaras:v2.5"
) as ws:
    await ws.translate(
        audio=request.audio_base64,
    )
    response = await ws.recv()
```

User's correct implementation:
```python
async with client.speech_to_text_translate_streaming.connect() as ws:
    # Send audio for translation
    await ws.translate(audio=audio_data)
    print("[Debug]: sent audio message")

    # Receive translation response
    resp = await ws.recv()
    print(f"[Debug]: received response: {resp}")
```

The main differences are:
1. Current code passes `model="saaras:v2.5"` to the connect method
2. The pattern is otherwise the same

Let me check if the issue might be that the model parameter shouldn't be passed, or maybe there are other issues. The user's example doesn't pass the model parameter. Let me update the implementation to match the user's correct example more closely and remove the model parameter.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue. The current implementation is passing the `model` parameter to the `connect()` method, but according to the correct implementation you provided, it should not include that parameter. Let me fix the transcribe endpoint:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've updated the transcribe endpoint to match the correct implementation the user provided. The key changes were:

1. Removed the `model="saaras:v2.5"` parameter from the `connect()` method
2. Added debug print statements to help with troubleshooting
3. Added error logging to the exception handler

The implementation now matches the correct pattern provided by the user. The transcribe function should now work properly with the SarvamAI SDK.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the transcribe endpoint to match the correct implementation you provided. The key changes were:

1. **Removed the `model` parameter** from `connect()` - it should be called without parameters
2. **Added debug logging** to help track the audio sending and response receiving
3. **Added error logging** in the exception handler

The implementation now correctly follows the pattern:
```python
async with client.speech_to_text_translate_streaming.connect() as ws:
    await ws.translate(audio=request.audio_base64)
    response = await ws.recv()
```

The transcribe endpoint should now work properly. You'll also see debug messages in the backend console when audio is sent and when responses are received, which will help with troubleshooting if any issues arise.

The log file doesn't show the recent error. Can you check your terminal where the backend is running? With the debug prints I added, you should see either:
- `[Debug]: sent audio message` and `[Debug]: received response: ...`
- OR an `[Error]: Transcription failed: ...` message

Let me also check if there might be an issue with how the frontend is sending the audio data:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/vinayakgavariya/aayucare/frontend/components/VoiceInput.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the frontend is sending the audio as base64 with encoding "audio/webm". However, the Sarvam AI API might need a specific audio format. Looking at the example code the user provided, it seems to expect WAV format.

The issue is likely that:
1. The frontend is recording in webm format
2. Sarvam AI might only accept WAV format

I should also check if the backend needs to handle the audio conversion or if we need to change the frontend to record in WAV format. Let me also check the actual error by looking at the backend more carefully.

Actually, I think the main issue is that we need to convert the webm audio to WAV format, or we need to change the frontend to record in WAV format directly. Let me create a solution that converts the audio on the backend side.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue - the frontend is sending `audio/webm` format, but the Sarvam AI API example you provided uses `audio/wav`. Let me check what error you're seeing in the backend terminal. Can you copy the full error message from the terminal?

In the meantime, let me also add better error handling to see the exact error:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can explain the complete flow to the user.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Here's the **complete flow** of how your app works:

## 📱 Voice-to-Results Flow:

### 1. **Voice Recording** (VoiceInput.tsx)
   - User clicks "Start Recording" 🎤
   - Records audio in their language

### 2. **Speech-to-Text** (Sarvam AI)
   - Audio → `/transcribe` endpoint
   - Sarvam AI converts voice to text
   - Shows transcribed text in blue box: *"Transcribed: [your text]"*

### 3. **AI Analysis** (Gemini + Google Maps)
   - Transcribed text → `/find-doctors` endpoint
   - Gemini analyzes symptoms + location
   - Searches Google Maps for nearby doctors

### 4. **Results Display** (ResultsPage.tsx)
   The page shows:
   
   **Left Column:**
   - 🟦 **Your Symptoms box** (lines 84-87) - Shows what was transcribed
   - ✅ **Recommendation section** (lines 130-150) - **This is the Gemini response!**
     - Medical advice
     - Which specialist you need
     - Brief explanation
   - 🏥 **Nearby Doctors list** (lines 153-216)
     - Doctor/clinic names
     - Addresses
     - Links to Google Maps
   
   **Right Column:**
   - 🗺️ **Map Widget** - Visual map of all locations
   
   **Tabs at top:**
   - "Doctors" (default)
   - "Labs" (fetches labs when clicked)
   - "Pharmacies" (fetches pharmacies when clicked)

So **the Gemini response is displayed in the "Recommendation" card** (the green checkmark section on lines 147-149). It shows the full AI-generated medical recommendation in the user's selected language!

Try it now - record something like *"I have fever in Mumbai"* and you'll see the complete flow! 🚀

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see the issue - the code at lines 104-108 shows that if the transcription is empty, it sets an error message and returns early. This means the transcription might be coming back empty. Let me check the backend logs to see what's happening with the Sarvam AI response.

The user should see either:
1. A transcribed text in a blue box
2. An error message in a red box
3. Or it's still "Processing..."

Let me check what the backend is logging when they record.</details></think>

I see the issue - if the transcription comes back empty, it shows an error message "Could not transcribe audio. Please try again." (line 105). Let me check what the backend is actually receiving and returning. Can you share what you see in your backend terminal after you clicked stop recording?

In the meantime, let me add better console logging to the frontend to help debug:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, now the frontend has better logging. But I think the real issue is that the Sarvam AI response structure might not be what we expect. Let me check the backend more carefully. The user should look at their backend terminal now.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Now I've added detailed console logging. Now please:

1. **Open your browser console** (press F12, go to "Console" tab)
2. **Try recording again** - say "I have fever" and click stop
3. **Share with me**:
   - What you see in the **browser console** (all the `[Frontend]` logs)
   - What you see in the **backend terminal** (all the `[Debug]` logs)

This will help me see exactly where the transcription is failing. The issue is likely one of:
- The Sarvam API response structure is different than expected
- The transcription field is empty
- There's an error in parsing the response

Please share both console outputs and I'll fix it immediately! 🔍

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is showing me the frontend console output. I can see that:
1. The audio is being recorded (different lengths: 120180, 35172, 50628 chars)
2. But I don't see the subsequent logs like "[Frontend] Transcribe response status:" or "[Frontend] Transcribe data:"

This means the request might not be completing, or there's an error happening. I need to see the backend logs to understand what's happening on the server side. Let me ask for the backend terminal output.

Actually, looking at the logs, it seems like multiple recordings are being tried. But we're not seeing the transcribe response logs, which suggests either:
1. The request is hanging
2. There's an error happening
3. The backend isn't responding

I should check what's in the backend terminal to see if the transcribe endpoint is even being called.</details></think>

---

Good! I can see the audio is being recorded (3 different attempts with different sizes). But I don't see the subsequent logs like `[Frontend] Transcribe response status:` which means the request is either hanging or failing silently.

Can you please share what you see in the **backend terminal** where you ran `python main.py`? You should see lines starting with `[Debug]: Starting transcription...`

Also, do you see any errors in the browser console? Scroll down in the console to see if there are any red error messages after those audio length logs.

In the meantime, let me check if there's a CORS or network issue. Can you also check the **Network tab** in your browser DevTools:
1. Press F12
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Try recording again
4. Look for a request to `/transcribe` - click on it and tell me what the status code is (200, 500, etc.)

This will help me understand if the request is even reaching the backend or if it's failing before that.

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue now! Looking at the backend logs:
```
[Debug]: sent audio message
INFO:     127.0.0.1:56252 - "OPTIONS /transcribe HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

The backend is sending the audio message but then the connection seems to hang - it never receives a response from Sarvam AI. The backend is waiting at `await ws.recv()` but never gets a response.

Looking at the HTML reference file, I can see that Sarvam AI uses a **WebSocket-based streaming API**, not a REST API with base64 audio in JSON! The HTML shows:
1. They connect to `wss://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text/ws`
2. They send audio in chunks via WebSocket
3. They receive transcription responses via WebSocket

But in the backend, we're using `client.speech_to_text_translate_streaming.connect()` which is trying to use the SDK's streaming translate API, not the speech-to-text WebSocket API.

The issue is that we're using the wrong API endpoint! The user provided an example for `speech_to_text_translate_streaming` which is for translation, not just transcription. We need to use the regular speech-to-text WebSocket API.

Let me fix this by using the correct Sarvam AI STT WebSocket API directly.</details></think>

Ah! I see the issue now! Looking at the backend logs, it says `[Debug]: sent audio message` but then hangs - it never receives a response. 

The problem is we're using the **wrong API**! The reference HTML you shared shows that Sarvam AI uses a **WebSocket STT API** at `wss://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text/ws`, not the `speech_to_text_translate_streaming` API (which is for translation, not transcription).

Let me fix the backend to use the correct Sarvam STT WebSocket API:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The server is running. Now I've completely rewritten the transcribe endpoint to use the correct Sarvam AI WebSocket STT API (wss://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text/ws) based on the HTML reference file the user provided.

The key changes:
1. Removed the AsyncSarvamAI SDK usage (which wasn't working)
2. Directly connect to Sarvam's WebSocket API using the websockets library
3. Send audio in the correct format: {"audio": {"data": base64, "encoding": "audio/wav", "sample_rate": 16000}}
4. Send a flush message to get the final transcription
5. Parse the response which comes as {"type": "data", "data": {"transcript": "..."}}

However, there's still an issue - the frontend is sending audio/webm format at 48000 Hz, but Sarvam expects audio/wav at 16000 Hz. We need to either:
1. Convert the audio format on the backend
2. Change the frontend to record in the correct format

Let me check if websockets package is installed, and if the backend can handle the audio format mismatch.</details></think>

---

Perfect! 🎉 The backend is now running with the **correct Sarvam AI WebSocket STT API** implementation!

**Key changes I made:**

1. ✅ Removed the `AsyncSarvamAI` SDK (which was using the wrong API)
2. ✅ Directly connect to `wss://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text/ws` using websockets
3. ✅ Send audio in the correct format Sarvam expects
4. ✅ Parse the WebSocket response correctly

**Now try recording again!** 🎤

Go to your browser and:
1. Click "Start Recording"
2. Say "I have fever in Mumbai"  
3. Click "Stop Recording"

You should now see detailed logs in the backend terminal like:
```
[Debug]: Connecting to Sarvam STT WebSocket...
[Debug]: WebSocket connected
[Debug]: Sent audio message
[Debug]: Sent flush message
[Debug]: Received response: {...}
[Debug]: Got transcript: I have fever in Mumbai
```

Share the backend logs if you see any errors! The transcription should work now. 🚀

**Note:** If there are still issues, it might be because the frontend sends `audio/webm` but Sarvam expects `audio/wav`. We may need to convert the audio format, but let's test first!

sarvam support wav nonly and not webm

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah! That's the issue! The frontend is recording audio in `audio/webm` format, but Sarvam AI only accepts `audio/wav` format. We need to convert the audio on either the frontend or backend.

Looking at the reference HTML file, they're using:
- Recording at 16kHz sample rate
- Converting Float32 audio to Int16
- Sending as audio/wav

We have two options:
1. Convert on frontend (record as WAV or convert webm to wav)
2. Convert on backend (convert webm to wav before sending to Sarvam)

The easiest approach is to change the frontend to record in a format that we can convert to WAV, or use a library to do the conversion. 

Actually, looking at the reference implementation, they're capturing raw audio using ScriptProcessor and converting it to Int16 PCM, then sending it as WAV. 

Let me update the frontend to record properly for Sarvam's STT API.</details></think>

Exactly! That's the issue. The frontend is recording in `audio/webm` format, but Sarvam only accepts `audio/wav` format. Looking at the reference HTML, they record audio at 16kHz and send it as WAV.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've updated the frontend to:
1. Record audio at 16kHz sample rate (as Sarvam requires)
2. Use ScriptProcessorNode to capture raw audio data
3. Convert Float32 audio to Int16 (as in the reference implementation)
4. Send it as audio/wav with 16000 sample rate

Now I need to make sure the backend also expects this format correctly. Let me check if there are any other issues. The frontend should now be properly recording and sending audio in the format Sarvam expects.

The key changes:
- Recording at 16kHz (not 48kHz)
- Using raw audio capture (not MediaRecorder with webm)
- Converting to Int16 PCM data
- Sending as audio/wav

This matches the reference HTML implementation exactly.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've updated the frontend to match Sarvam's requirements:

**Key changes:**
1. ✅ Record at **16kHz** sample rate (not 48kHz)
2. ✅ Use **ScriptProcessorNode** to capture raw audio (not MediaRecorder)
3. ✅ Convert **Float32 to Int16** PCM data (as Sarvam requires)
4. ✅ Send as **audio/wav** format

Now try recording again! 🎤

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Say something like "I have fever in Mumbai"
4. Click "Stop Recording"

You should now see in the browser console:
```
[Frontend] Audio length: XXXX chars
[Frontend] Audio samples: XXXX
[Frontend] Transcribe response status: 200
[Frontend] Transcribe data: {...}
```

And in the backend terminal:
```
[Debug]: Connecting to Sarvam STT WebSocket...
[Debug]: WebSocket connected
[Debug]: Sent audio message
[Debug]: Sent flush message
[Debug]: Received response: {...}
[Debug]: Got transcript: I have fever in Mumbai
```

Let me know what you see! If there are still issues, share the logs from both browser console and backend terminal. 🚀

let's host it on vercel now 

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to host the application on Vercel now. Let me think about what needs to be done:

1. Frontend can be hosted on Vercel easily (it's a Next.js app)
2. Backend needs to be hosted separately (Vercel doesn't support Python backends well for production, and the websocket connection might have issues)
3. I should check if there's already deployment configuration
4. The backend should probably be hosted on a service like Render, Railway, or Heroku
5. We need to update environment variables and CORS settings

Let me check what deployment files already exist and create a plan.</details></think>

---

Great! Let's deploy your app. Since you have a Next.js frontend and Python FastAPI backend, here's the deployment strategy:

**Frontend → Vercel** (Perfect for Next.js)
**Backend → Render** (I see you already have `render.yaml`)

Let me check your existing deployment files and set everything up:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/vinayakgavariya/aayucare/backend/render.yaml

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to:

_**User (2025-10-18 18:56Z)**_

wait i don't want to pay

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user doesn't want to pay for hosting. Let me suggest free hosting options:

1. **Frontend (Next.js):** Vercel is FREE for hobby projects (perfect for this)
2. **Backend (FastAPI):** Render has a free tier, but it might be limited. Let me check other free options:
   - Render Free Tier - 750 hours/month (sleeps after inactivity)
   - Railway Free Tier - $5 credit/month
   - Fly.io - limited free tier
   - PythonAnywhere - free tier available

Vercel is completely free for personal/hobby projects, so no worries there. The backend can be hosted on Render's free tier.

Let me explain the free options clearly.</details></think>

---

No worries! Both can be hosted **completely FREE**:

## ✅ Free Hosting Options:

### **Frontend - Vercel** (100% FREE)
- Free forever for hobby/personal projects
- Unlimited bandwidth
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- **No credit card required**

### **Backend - Render** (FREE Tier)
- 750 hours/month (enough for 24/7)
- Sleeps after 15 mins of inactivity (wakes up in ~1 min)
- 512MB RAM
- **No credit card required**

**OR Backend - Railway** (FREE)
- $5 free credit every month
- No sleep (stays active)
- Better than Render free tier

---

## 🚀 Let's deploy for FREE!

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Vercel + Render)

**Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render (5 minutes)**

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up (free, no credit card)
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Fill in:
   - **Name:** aayucare-api
   - **Root Directory:** `backend`
   - **Environment:** Python 3
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. Add Environment Variables:
   - `SARVAM_API_KEY` = (your key)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` = (your key)
6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. Wait 2-3 minutes, copy the URL (e.g., `https://aayucare-api.onrender.com`)

**Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (3 minutes)**

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up (free, no credit card)
2. Click "Add New" → "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repo
4. Set **Root Directory:** `frontend`
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = (paste Render URL from step 1)
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Done! You'll get a URL like `https://aayucare.vercel.app`

---

**Do you want me to:**
1. Create deployment documentation with these steps?
2. Help you set up GitHub first (if not already)?
3. Try a different free option like Railway?

All options are **completely free** - no credit card needed! 🎉
